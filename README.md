# Style Mask Helper

Style Mask Helper adds a variety of "mask" entities that change certain aspects of the level's visuals for just a specified area, and optionally smoothly fade them!

This mod currently contains:

- Styleground Masks
- Lighting Masks
- Color Grade Masks
- Bloom Masks

## Usage

### Styleground Masks

To mask a styleground, give it a tag with the `mask_` prefix, and use the same tag (without the prefix) inside the styleground mask options. For example, if you give a styleground the `mask_stars` tag, you'll want to put `stars` as the "Tag" option for your styleground mask.

Stylegrounds with a `mask_` tag will not be visible outside of a styleground mask!


### Custom Fade

**Note: This does not currently work in many cases! Use at your own risk in case fixes change stuff.**

All masks can be given an image for their shape instead of just a rectangle using the "Custom" fade mode by placing an image inside the `Gameplay/fademasks` graphics folder, and setting the "Custom Fade" option to the image's path (relative to the `fademasks` folder).

The image should only consist of transparency and white, where the white is where your mask will render. [Check the default masks that come with the mod for examples.](Graphics/Atlases/Gameplay/fademasks/)

## Known Issues

- Custom Fade has issues with every mask type right now
- Heat Wave effect displacement rendering does not work properly with styleground masks
- Some styleground effects (specifically discovered with Custom Wind Snow from CrystallineHelper) are sped up when masked

## Building

Building the project requires a modified Celeste executable, and since I dont know if I can commit that to a public GitHub you need to make your own (also these are just Windows instructions)

### 1. Download an assembly publicizer

Download **one** of the following:

- [NStrip](https://github.com/bbepis/NStrip)
- [BepInEx Assembly Publicizer](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx.AssemblyPublicizer)

NStrip is a small portable executable that you can download and place next to the file you want to publicize. \
BepInEx is convenient if you have the dotnet CLI.

### 2. Create a publicized executable

With the publicizer installed and/or placed next to your Celeste executable, run the following command:

**BepInEx**  
`assembly-publicizer --strip Celeste.exe`

**NStrip**  
`NStrip.exe -p Celeste.exe` 

### 3. Place inside the mod

Move your newly generated `Celeste-publicized.exe` or `Celeste-nstrip.exe` to the `lib-stripped` folder inside the Style Mask Helper code, and rename it to `Celeste.exe`.

The project should now be able to access private Celeste variables without errors!
